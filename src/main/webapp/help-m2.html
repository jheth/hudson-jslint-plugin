<div>
<p>Hudson understands <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jslint4java/">JSLint</a>
analysis report XML format. When this option is configured and your
build runs the maven goal <code>jslint:jslint</code> then Hudson provides
useful information about analysis results, such as historical result
trend, module and package statistics, web UI for viewing analysis
reports and warnings, and so on.</p>
<p>This plug-in is not invoked for failed builds, it is only called for
stable or unstable builds (i.e., a build with failed tests).</p>
